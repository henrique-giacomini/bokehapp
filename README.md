# Polycondensation

Polycondensation, also called step polymerization because of its synthesis mechanism,
is an important technique used to produce polymer materials like the polyamides (eg. nylon).
Many chemical reaction can be employed to proceed the condensation, such as esterification, amidation,
urethanes, etc. However the kinematics of those reactions still the same.

This simple app shows the mass distribution of the polymer, an important feature to controll the material properties,  in therms of mass and the stechiometric balance initial.
